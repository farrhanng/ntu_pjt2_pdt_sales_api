Group Project Plan
As a group, make a joint decision to decide what to include in your DevOps CICD Pipeline for this project. You should minimally achieve the following:

Using Git Flow, only the release branch will run both CI and CD.
When there are code updates on develop branch, simply perform CI.
The release branch shall trigger a workflow named cicd_flow while the develop branch shall trigger ci_flow.
There should be minimally one unit test to simulate test pass and fail. When the test fail, CD should not be executed in the release branch.
You should include snyk scan in your CI pipeline.
